Welcome to the Paw society,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod to present my final project about full stack frameworks with Django.

# UX-Desing

Offers banner gives the opportunity to catch the user's attention with an attractive service deal.

The main colour to give contrast to the site is `#B05D44` as in the company's logo. 

# Technology Practices

`pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` to make sure all python packages are gathered together to make the app work.

Every new app created with `python3 manage.py startapp _name_` has to be loaded into the settings.py file and run the following commands:
`python3 manage.py makemigrations` and to apply this `python3 manage.py migrate`

### Payment methods
To ensure our passwords are kept only in virtual environment, we need to add on the CLI `export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=Â£$%%^&BGG`. Not very handy as you need to upload them on the CLI evrytime.

Implement neccessary javascript statements on stripe_elementns.json


# Testing

* remote: error: File core.Microsoft.Pytho.3919.1594814483 is 225.15 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB
I'm leaving a note here in case I get the same error. type this on the CLI `git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f core.Microsoft*' HEAD` and add this file toi your .gitignore file `core.Microsoft* `

* Products not showing on Shop page: When I set up my JSON files, I did it with one entry only and after I added the rest of files but it wasn't showing on my Shop page. The solution was to load the data again with `python3 manage.py loaddata products.json`.

* TemplateSyntaxError("Could not parse the remainder: '%s' " django.template.exceptions.TemplateSyntaxError: Could not parse the remainder...
Solution: I was using `{{ url 'product_detail' product.id }}` instead of `{% url 'product_detail' product.id %}` to link pages.

* UnboundLocalError: local variable 'query' referenced before assignment. I was getting this error on my shop section because I wasn't declaring the value of `query` before the `if` statement.

* TypeError: 'class Meta' got invalid attribute(s): name,friendly_name
Solution: I was calling my attributes on a class model inside the model Meta, by indenting it a level up on the class, attributes were working.

* 'bag_tools' is not a registered tag library. Must be one of
Solution: Make sure that you create templetatags folder at the same level as templates folder, not inside it as they work together to general the subtotal of every item on the shopping page.

* ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'products' (https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/no-module-named-pages/280669)
Solution: I was calling the folder withing the templates and no the app or module.

* ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured.
Solution: Always register the fields on the admin interface `admin.site.register(Voucher, VoucherAdmin)`. I noticed this error by running `python3 manage.py check voucher`

* 'Settings' object has no attribute 'FREE_TRIM_THRESHOLD'
Unsolved: After several attempts to I could make a calculation for the FREE_TRIM_TRESHOLD so it would send a number voucher to exchange for the free services.
